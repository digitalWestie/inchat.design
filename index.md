## Capture rich stories of users, customers, and services

<p class="centre">We combine design ethnography, chatbot technology, and data insights.</p><br/><br/><br/>
 
### Chatbot ethnography

We use chatbots to make simple conversation with users to elicit, gather, and understand their perspectives. Presented in a familiar format, users are able to tell us about their experiences in real time.

The conversational dialgoues are designed to probe the identified themes and key insights for each use case. This includes open-ended questions to encourage users to elaborate and describe their problems, thoughts, and suggestions.

The output of these conversations are recorded and then visualised quantitatively and made readable for qualitative evaluation.

Participants are encouraged to share their story with video, audio, or anything else they want to reference.

#### Benefits

- Scalable, low-cost engagement
- Rich multimedia narrative
- Easy, understandable chat app format
- Decreased observer effect
- Real time & context rich
- Generative & open ended

#### Moving beyond traditional user research methods, towards a more than human perspective

### About us

Our methods and perspectives were originally developed for the purposes of research in the Design Informatics Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh under the STiPS project, Smart Transactions in Public Spaces. As the research project came to a close, we still had vested interest in developing these methods and platform for service design. We find our technology and methodology to be applicable to most organisations, at any stage between SME or large corporation. In particular, we see an opportunity to address the need to understand end-to-end user journeys across time and space.

### About the Research

The initial driver for research has been focused on studying visitor transactions in festivals and markets such that the stories and value constellations of various stakeholders could be read and understood. 

An ethnographic chatbot was first deployed for a study at the Royal Highland Show, and more recently, for the Edinburgh City Council Public Art Research Project.

Working with RBS the chatbot was put through its first field trial at the Royal Highland Show in June, participants took the app with them for a morning or an afternoon as part of their Royal Highland Show experience. Here participants were asked to explore three specific areas of RHS at random and answer specific questions about these places, the types of values experienced and exchanged.

Working with Edinburgh City Council was the third phase of research under their Public Art Research Project to help rethink the Public Art commission process. Here we requested key stakeholders to have a conversation in public space as they move around three specific public works of art. It was a curated moment focused around transformative and contentious spaces, as well as problematizing the development of new works of art.
